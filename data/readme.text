# E. coli Pangenome-Scale Metabolic Model Reconstruction and Analysis

**“Pangenome-Scale Metabolic Network Reconstruction Reveals a Diverse Genetic Basis for Metabolic Reactions.”**

This repository contains data and code for the pangenome-scale metabolic reconstruction of *Escherichia coli*, enabling detailed analysis of its metabolic diversity. By analyzing gene–protein–reaction (GPR) associations across thousands of strains, this work quantifies the genetic basis of *E. coli* metabolism and the evolutionary dynamics shaping metabolic functions.
